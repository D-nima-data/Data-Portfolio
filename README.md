# Nima Dehghani - Portfolio
Hi, I’m Nima Dehghani — a data-driven problem solver with a background in Agile leadership, digital learning development, and renewable-energy-focused engineering projects. I’ve led cross-functional teams, built national-scale digital platforms, and delivered solutions used by more than 30,000 learners across Australia.
My work sits at the intersection of technology, education, engineering and analytics. At Weld Australia, I progressed from Graduate Learning Developer to Digital Education Manager, where I designed and delivered a nationally consistent digital learning ecosystem. I created data-supported workflows, developed scalable content strategies, and introduced multimedia storytelling to improve engagement and outcomes. I developed the digital education learning resources section of Weld Australia from scratch and was able to deliver high quality products with the help of my team. 
Earlier roles strengthened my technical versatility: from building SEO-driven digital growth as a Marketing & Sales Manager, to developing a solar-powered battery payment system during an engineering project in Cambodia. Across each project, I’ve focused on turning complexity into clear, actionable solutions.

Now based in Berlin, I’m expanding my work into energy, renewables, and analytics. This portfolio showcases the projects I’m developing to grow my technical skill set — including data analysis, visualization, automation, and tools that support clean-energy innovation.

Thanks for stopping by — I’m always open to collaborating, learning, and contributing to impactful projects.
